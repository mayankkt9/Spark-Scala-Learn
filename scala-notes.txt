Some Features of Scala Programming 
	- Supports both Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming
	- Immutable Object (Object whose state cant)
	- Referential Transparency (function replaced by its result)


 Functional Programming is way of writing software application using only pure functions and immutable values.

 library design and data crunching problems (Read later)


 What functions are pure functions 
 	- Input solely determines the output (There are no other global variable or any other input other than parameter that determines the output)
 	- The function doesnt change the input (Doesnt have pass by value or reference feature)
 	- The function doesnt do anything else except computing the output. (Doesnt change global variable state or do anything else)
